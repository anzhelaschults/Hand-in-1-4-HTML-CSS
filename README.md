Project Title:
HTML meets CSS

Description:
Goals: practise HTML, CSS, publish code on GitHub.

Managing expectations: it is a basic intro to HTML and CSS practice. I am still choosing between to do my own blog vs todo app project, so CSS will be more advanced. With the next submission I will use my own project that will be evolving.

Task:
3 HTML pages which are linked to each other, styled using a variety of CSS rules (without framework). All pages are responsive, using media queries and at least 2 breakpoints.
