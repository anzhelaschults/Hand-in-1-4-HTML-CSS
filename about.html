    <h2><strong>Responsive Web Design</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing
        experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of
        devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones). A responsive design automatically adjusts to fit the
        device's screen size.

    <h2><strong>Breakpoints</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Breakpoints are specific media query values that target certain screen sizes or device types, allowing you to
        apply different styles depending on the device's characteristics, most commonly its width. For example, you
        might have one set of CSS styles for large screens (like desktop monitors) and a different set for small screens
        (like smartphones).</p>
