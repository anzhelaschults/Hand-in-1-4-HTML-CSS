    <blockquote>
        <strong>What does the web browser do?</strong>A web browser is like a magic window that shows you the things you
        want to see on the internet. When you type a website's name into the browser, it goes and gets all the pictures
        and words that make up that website and shows them to you. It can also help you go back to pages you've seen
        before, and it keeps some things saved so that the next time you visit a page, it loads faster. There are
        different kinds of web browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, and they all have special features that make
        using the internet easier and more fun
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote><strong>What is HTML?</strong>HyperText Markup Language is the code that is used to structure a web page
        and its content. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is like a set of instructions for building a web page. It
        defines the structure of web pages and tells web browsers how to display text, images, and other content on a
        webpage. HTML consists of elements that are written using angle brackets, such as p for paragraphs and img
        for images. It's the basic language used to create web pages, and it works together with other technologies
        like CSS and JavaScript to make web pages look good and interactive. HTML has evolved over the years, with
        HTML5 being the latest version, adding new features to create and display content on the web.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><strong>What is CSS?</strong>Cascading Style Sheets, is like a magic paintbrush for web pages. While
        HTML defines the structure and content of a web page, CSS is used to decorate it and control how it looks. It's
        the tool that web designers use to make websites pretty and easy to read. CSS can change the colors, fonts, and
        layout of a web page, making it look just the way you want. It works together with HTML to create the websites
        you see on the internet</blockquote>
    <blockquote><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong>It is a programming language that makes websites interactive and
        dynamic. It can be used to create games, animate images, and control multimedia. JavaScript works together with
        HTML and CSS to build and style web pages. It is widely used on the web, with almost all websites using it to
        some extent. JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly, and with more experience, it can be used to create
        complex applications, games, and much more</blockquote>
